Swinging knives of lies now only brings me pain
As they dig around and tear so deep into my veins
A pathetic love that's spilt unto the ground
The things that I had loved all turned their back and laugh at me now

No Fiction...

The maths and science I like the best of all
Cause when thinking round to English my skin starts to crawl
Looking back now to sort out just which one was right
Every answer I sought had vanished far from my sight.

The homework today is,
about me Mr. Faceless,
so simple I don't know how,
I guess that's just my life now,
But then sometimes I wonder
thinking always I wonder
Why we say we're lonely,
as I scream to hold me

Can you read to me the Kanji written up on the board?
Can you read all of the words within this heart that is torn?
And who stepped in this heart and dyed it all into black?
Now who could it be?
Now who could it be?

Can you solve all these equations using an abacus?
Can you loosen up the noose that is constricting our trust?
Can we keep on moving forward down this long painful road?
Now come tell me how
I don't give a damn now!

And no matter how much time passes us by,
We're drunk on sweet and hypnotic lies.
With all our sources of hardened pride
We try to erase and hide now

The homework I can't take,
no answer there is no way
I'm through I never knew how,
I guess that's just my life now,
But then sometimes I wonder,
why our hearts close off and stutter
and we all close our eyes,
and we wish we'd just die.

Can you read to me Kanji written up on the board?
Can you read all of the words within this heart that is torn?
And who stepped in this heart and dyed it all into black?
Now who could it be?
Now who could it be?

Can you solve all these equations using an abacus?
Can you loosen up the noose that is constricting our trust?
Can we keep on moving forward down this long painful road?
Now come tell me how
Now come tell me how

Come read to me the formula for area next
Come and list all of the dreams that you once had in your head
And the one that went and dumped all of those dreams down the drain
Now who could it be?
It's just as it seems

Tell me when will you finally grow up like they say?
Tell me what the hell does it mean to go grow up anyway?
Tell me where can I turn to find the answers I need?
Now come tell me how
I don't give a damn now!
